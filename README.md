# Creep

Selecting people to review your code is hard. It's to remember who you
picked last and who you always ping too much for pull requests.
Creep is a script that picks 4 people to review my code at random and
prints them to the console.

If you have Bloc-Alpha access this is a port of my [script/reviewers](https://github.com/Bloc/Bloc/blob/master/script/reviewers)

## Setup

Download the latest [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

`$ go install`

## Run

`$ creep`
